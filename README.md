## Recreating a Flash Game with Modern Technology


In 2002, I had the audacity to call myself a Flash professional, and someone paid me to write a few articles. In one of them, I taught readers how to create a simple Flash game. Now, as we celebrate both the web's progress and the nostalgia of early browser games, I'm going to recreate this project using modern technology.

While the original code is lost to time—a common fate for Flash content—this gives us a fresh start with current web standards. I'll follow just one rule: No build scripts or frameworks. Modern browsers provide all the native capabilities we need, making external tools often unnecessary. This back-to-basics approach is surprisingly liberating, letting us focus on pure web technologies while hopefully creating more maintainable, longer-lasting code.

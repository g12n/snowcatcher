Recreating a flash game with modern techology.

In 2002 I had the odacity to call myself a flash professional and somebody payed me to write a few articles for them. In one of them i taught how to create a little flash game. Celebrating the progress the web has made and the nostalgia of early web browser games lets recreate this one in modern technology.

Rules:
Theres only one rule: No build skripts or frameworks. It's very liberating that the browser now gives us everything we need to create. Frameworks often get in the way of that.
